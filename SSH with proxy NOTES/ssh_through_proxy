Connecting to ssh through proxychains...

configure proxy chain /etc/proxychains.conf

http 192.168.56.101 3128  Where 3128 is squid proxy port

and then 

proxychains ssh john@192.168.56.101


Or we can use ssh tunneling to connect with remote host...

proxytunnel -p 192.168.1.24:3128 -d 127.0.0.1:22 -a 1234

Then 

ssh john@127.0.0.1 -p 1234

you'll be connected...

We can use /bin/bash after the port if .bashrch is configured wrongly...

ssh john@127.0.0.1 -p 1234 /bin/bash
