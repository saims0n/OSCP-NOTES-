On out local py use this command to forward the remote port to our local pc...
we need password of the remote host and listening port which we're going to forward.

here -L is local port: mean our port on which we're going to listen to server request...

127.0.0.1 is our ip where we're tunneling the service...

8080 is remote port where service is running on this port..

then username and remote ip...


  ssh -L 8082:127.0.0.1:8080 poseidon@192.168.56.38


now we can surf as---:>  http://localhost:8082/




Using socket we can tunnet the remote port to our pc...
to do this we need shell of the remote host and execute this command to remote to tunnel the port to every ip...on remote.

  socat TCP-LISTEN:8081,fork TCP:127.0.0.1:8080


where tcp-listen:8081 is our port where we want to listen...

tcp:127.0.0.1 is remote localhost where service is running

8080 is port on which service is running...

socket used to tunnel for every network phases of the remote host...

i mean : 0.0.0.0:8080  socket do this to the local port




One More Example of Tunneling with socat...


Theres two more sites are enabled....


since we don't have the ssh password we are not able to tunnel the port using ssh

so we're going to use socat to tunnel to local port ...



port 80 tunnelinig....8888

socat TCP-LISTEN:8888,fork TCP:127.0.0.1:80 &

port 6534 tunniling...to 7777

socat TCP-LISTEN:7777,fork TCP:127.0.0.1:65334 &

Now we can browse both of the with their ip 192.168.56.48:8888 (7777 for another)
