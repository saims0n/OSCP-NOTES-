Shell Spawning

    python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

    echo os.system('/bin/bash')

    /bin/sh -i

    perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'

    perl: exec "/bin/sh";

    ruby: exec "/bin/sh"

    lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')

    (From within IRB)

    exec "/bin/sh"

    (From within vi)

    :!bash

    (From within vi)

    :set shell=/bin/bash:shell

    (From within nmap)

    !sh
 
 This will work most of the time when there is no python
 
        /usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
        
     Cltr+z 
     stty raw -echo;fg               

you'll get the proper shell
